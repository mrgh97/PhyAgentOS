# PhyAgentOS User Manual

[中文](../zh/02-user-manual.md) · [Documentation index](../README.md)

> Documentation version: 1.0.0.

## 1. Install and initialize

PhyAgentOS supports Python 3.11 and 3.12. Forge Gateway, Dora, robot drivers, simulator assets,
and locked node artifacts are deployed separately when a robot Skill needs them.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhyAgentOS/PhyAgentOS.git
cd PhyAgentOS
python -m pip install -e .
paos onboard
```

For development:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
ruff check PhyAgentOS tests
```

The default configuration is `~/.PhyAgentOS/config.json`; the default workspace is
`~/.PhyAgentOS/workspace`.

### Dora CLI for managed Skill profiles

Dora is not needed to run the general Agent, search for a Skill, or complete `paos skill install`.
It is a host prerequisite for `paos skill start`, because RuntimeManager uses the `dora` command to
manage the selected profile. PhyAgentOS 1.0.0 uses Dora CLI v0.4.1 and `dora-message` v0.7.0 as its
Forge Skill compatibility baseline; pin this exact release for reproducible deployments.

Linux or macOS, using the versioned official installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/releases/download/v0.4.1/dora-cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/releases/download/v0.4.1/dora-cli-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

With an existing Rust toolchain:

```bash
cargo install dora-cli --version 0.4.1 --locked
```

Open a new shell if the installer changed `PATH`, then verify the executable:

```bash
dora --version
# dora-cli 0.4.1
# dora-message: 0.7.0
```

RuntimeManager verifies the command interface but does not enforce the semantic version or upgrade
Dora automatically. Operators must keep the CLI, coordinator, daemon, and locked Skill Nodes on
the compatible protocol generation. The currently published Forge Skill Nodes use message format
v0.7.0; Dora v0.5.0 uses v0.8.0 and rejects those Nodes during registration.

The Python package `dora-rs` is the Python node/operator API and is not a substitute for installing
the Dora CLI. Before a coordinator and daemon are running, `dora check` is expected to report that
they are unavailable. `paos skill start` runs this check and starts them with `dora up` when needed;
after a Runtime has started, `dora check` should succeed. See the
[official Dora v0.4.1 release](https://github.com/dora-rs/dora/releases/tag/v0.4.1) for platform
assets and checksums. Do not follow an unversioned installer that can select a newer CLI.

## 2. Configure the model and Forge

Configure one supported model provider and the Forge timeout/evidence policy. Runtime selection is
not a configuration switch; it follows the Skill profile that you start explicitly. Configuration
is serialized in camelCase and also accepts snake_case.

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "~/.PhyAgentOS/workspace",
      "model": "openrouter/openai/gpt-4o-mini",
      "provider": "openrouter"
    },
    "verification": {
      "serviceEnabled": true,
      "evidenceRetention": "failed",
      "maxReplansPerEpisode": 2
    },
    "evolution": {
      "enabled": true,
      "minSuccessfulEpisodes": 3,
      "minLessonEpisodes": 3
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {"apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
  },
  "forge": {
    "requestTimeoutS": 10,
    "pollIntervalS": 0.5,
    "executionTimeoutS": 300,
    "evidence": {
      "requiredImageSources": ["front"],
      "associationQuality": "best_effort"
    }
  },
  "resourceRegistry": {"url": "https://paos-resource-manager.dev.x-era.com"}
}
```

The active Skill Runtime manifest is the only source of the Gateway URL. The Registry URL can also
be supplied with `PAOS_RESOURCE_REGISTRY_URL`; an empty URL permits only local bundles or an
explicit static index. Starting PAOS never downloads a Skill.

## 3. Install and run a Skill Runtime

Use a configured Registry or a schema-v3 static package index:

```bash
paos skill search <skill-name>
paos skill install <skill-name> --version <version>
# or: paos skill install <skill-name> --index /path/to/index.json
# or: paos skill install /path/to/<skill-name>-<version>.tar.gz --local

paos skill list
paos skill inspect <skill-name>
paos skill start <skill-name> --profile <profile>
paos skill status <skill-name>
paos skill switch <other-skill-name> --profile <profile>
```

`install` verifies archive size, SHA-256, the embedded file inventory, manifest v2, and locked
nodes before atomically replacing a Skill. A verified Skill lock supplies a Node digest when the
Registry omits that duplicate field; the Node download size is resolved before transfer. The
public Registry resolves a Skill by name; `--version` is checked against the downloaded manifest
before any Node download or installation commit.

Before Dora starts, a Bundle may run `start.sh` as
`bash <bundle>/start.sh <skill-name> <skill-version>` with terminal stdio inherited. These Bundles
require Bash on `PATH`; a missing Bash or non-zero hook exit records `failed` and prevents Dora from
starting. Bundles without the hook keep the normal cross-platform path. Status remains `starting`
while a long hook, such as an external asset download, is active. After the hook succeeds, PAOS
launches the named Dora profile and checks Gateway `/tools` and every required Tool context.
Overlapping lifecycle changes for the same Skill are rejected immediately. Inspect lifecycle output with
`paos skill logs <skill-name>`; stop with `paos skill stop <skill-name>`. `switch` refuses to run
while an AgentTask is non-terminal, verifies the target before publishing it, and restores the
previous Runtime if a same-Gateway target cannot start. A running Agent follows the persisted
selection before its next activation or Forge Tool call.

Node artifacts can be managed independently:

```bash
paos forge-node install <skill-name> <node-id>
# or install an independently obtained local archive
paos forge-node install <skill-name> <node-id> --archive /path/to/<node>.tar.gz
paos forge-node verify <skill-name> <node-id>
```

Concrete Forge Skills, nodes, models, and simulator assets are distributed separately from
PhyAgentOS and installed only when needed.

## 4. Start PAOS

Start the managed Skill Runtime/Gateway before the Agent when using an installed robot Skill.
`paos skill start` checks the Dora CLI and starts the local Dora coordinator and daemon when they
are not already ready. The Agent obtains the Gateway URL only from the explicitly active Skill
manifest.

```bash
paos status
paos skill start <skill-name> --profile <profile>
paos skill status <skill-name>
paos agent

# one request
paos agent -m "Inspect the motion Tool context, move the gripper forward 5 cm, and verify the result."

# long-running channels, Cron, Heartbeat, and Agent
paos gateway
```

## 5. Inspect Tool context

Before a Tool call, use `forge_tool_context(tool_id)`. It returns the ToolSpec together with live
binding, readiness, endpoint status, and robot frame information. The Agent must use the exact
input schema and must not infer frame or unit conventions.

The active Skill workflow declares the allowed Tool IDs and their Query, Action, or Session
semantics. Do not substitute a similar-looking Tool that is absent from its binding.

## 6. Use diagnostic Query or bound execution

A diagnostic Query uses the same Tool API but is not included in user-task verification:

```text
forge_tool_query(tool_id, arguments)
```

For a user-visible multi-call task:

1. Call `activate_skill(name, role="primary")` during the current turn.
2. Pass its activation ID to `forge_task_create(task_description, verification, activation_id)`.
3. Pass the returned `task_id` to every contributing Query, Action, or Session.
4. Reconcile every asynchronous invocation by its returned `invocation_id`; never invent or retry it after an unknown admission.
5. Stop task-owned Sessions, then call `forge_task_finalize(task_id)`.

Only one AgentTask may be non-terminal globally. Diagnostic Query does not occupy this slot, and all
execution still competes according to Gateway operation `max_concurrency`.

## 7. Define verification

For `audit`, `enforce`, or `recovery`, provide a goal and at least one success criterion:

```json
{
  "mode": "recovery",
  "goal": "The gripper is 5 cm forward from its starting pose.",
  "success_criteria": [
    "The final end-effector pose is approximately 5 cm forward in the declared frame.",
    "The robot reports no collision or motion failure."
  ],
  "constraints": ["Keep orientation unchanged."],
  "evidence_policy": {
    "required_kinds": ["rgb_image"],
    "required_sources": ["front"],
    "minimum_association": "best_effort"
  }
}
```

| Mode | Behavior |
|:-----|:---------|
| `off` | Derives the task result from bound Tool execution facts. |
| `audit` | Records semantic verification while preserving the execution-derived result. |
| `enforce` | Semantic verification controls success and fails closed on missing/invalid verification. |
| `recovery` | Same as enforce; `replan_required` permits a bounded new PlanRevision. |

If finalization returns `awaiting_replan`, call
`forge_task_begin_revision(task_id, reason)` and continue using the same task ID. Do not create a
second task or retry an invocation whose physical effect is unknown.

## 8. Cancellation and unknown outcomes

`forge_tool_cancel_action(invocation_id)` requests cancellation. A response such as `requested` or
`accepted` confirms only control-message handling. Continue checking status/result until Gateway
reports a known terminal result. `unknown` and local timeout are terminal for task accounting but
do not prove physical stop.

`forge_task_cancel(task_id, reason)` requests cancellation for all non-terminal bound Actions and
moves the task to `cancelling`. Reconcile the invocations, inspect physical state if necessary, and
finalize explicitly. Runtime stop remains gated while uncertain invocations are tracked unless an
operator deliberately uses force.

## 9. Experience, activation, and evolution

Use `activate_skill(name, role)` before the first workflow tool call when a registered Skill
matches. Workspace, installed, and built-in Skills are discovered in that priority order. Runtime
availability is part of activation eligibility.

Experience records all Agent tool calls and associates AgentTask, PlanRevisions, invocation
references, verification, and explicit Skill activation with one episode. Scoped Lessons are
advisory and cannot replace task criteria or evidence. Evolution is fail-open; a reflection error
does not alter execution or verification.

## 10. Persistence and retention

```text
<workspace>/
├── .paos/agent_tasks/tasks.sqlite3
├── .paos/evolution/experience.sqlite3
├── .paos/evolution/revisions/<skill>/
├── skills/<skill>/
└── artifacts/agent_tasks/<task_id>/
    ├── before_snapshot.json
    ├── after_snapshot.json
    ├── evidence_bundle.json
    └── evidence/
```

Back up SQLite files together with their WAL/SHM files while PAOS is stopped, plus the complete
artifact and Skill revision trees. `evidenceRetention` controls evidence after verification; it
does not delete execution records or evolution history.

## 11. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|:--------|:------|
| Tool not found or not ready | Run `forge_tool_context`; confirm ToolSpec, binding, Endpoint, and Runtime profile. |
| Skill will not install | Confirm Skill bundle metadata has size and SHA-256, every Node lock has a SHA-256, and each Registry/index Node resolves to a sized direct download. |
| Skill will not start | Run `paos skill status` and `logs`; verify Dora, dataflow paths, assets, nodes, and Gateway `/tools`. |
| Dora reports message format v0.7.0 versus v0.8.0 | Stop the mismatched coordinator/daemon, install Dora CLI v0.4.1, verify `dora-message: 0.7.0`, then start the Skill again. |
| Another task is active | Read the known task with `forge_task_get`; finish or cancel it instead of editing SQLite. |
| Action result is pending | Continue status/result reconciliation using the same `invocation_id`. |
| Action result is unknown | Inspect Gateway, Dora, and physical state; do not retry blindly. |
| Verification fails | Inspect task criteria, Tool records, evidence bundle, and verifier availability. |
| No Skill Lessons load | Confirm explicit activation, Runtime availability, and eligible active scoped Lessons. |
